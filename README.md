About Me
===

Hi, my name is Lou. 

I'm an undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Business at New York University.

I am most familliar with Ruby and its MVC, Rails. I've also worked with JavaScript and am studying Java & Python.

New technology, iOS development and e-commerce particularly interest me.

I love working with people that are passionate about what they do, and I'm willing to give anything an enthusiastic try.
