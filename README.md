About Me
===

Hi, my name is Lou. 

I'm an undergraduate student double majoring in Computer Science and Business at New York University.

I am most familliar with Ruby, and have created several projects using Ruby on Rails. I'm currently coding with Java in my university classes. I've worked with HTML & CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. 

Wearable technology, iOS development and entrepreneurship particularly interest me.

I love working with people that are passionate about what they do, and I'm willing to give anything an enthusiastic try.
