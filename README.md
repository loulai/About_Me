About me
===

Hi, I'm Lou. 

I'm an undergraduate student at New York University, studying Computer Science and Business.

I'm most familliar with Ruby and its MVC, Rails. I've also worked with JavaScript and am studying Java & Python.

New technology, iOS development and e-commerce particularly interest me.

I love working with people that are passionate about what they do, and I'm willing to give anything a try. Check out my other experience and contact me [here].
